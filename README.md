# Hello 👋

I'm a professional software engineer with 10 years of experience and I work mainly as a full stack developer, developing APIs and front-end applications from scratch. I also do DevOps, working daily with Kubernetes, creating and configuring Helm charts and implementing observability solutions or testing pipelines.

You can read my blog at [https://nuculabs.dev](https://blog.nuculabs.dev). I write various technical posts 💬.

I also have a [private Git server](https://forge.nuculabs.dev/dnutiu) instance on which I host all my projects.
