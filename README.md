### Hi there 👋

🧑‍💻

I’m Denis, a programmer living in 🇷🇴 Romania. I’m passionate about **cloud computing** and **software development** ✨.

During my day to day work I develop software in Python, Go, JavaScript and Java. I've been working on CLIs, microservices, back-end web applications, Apache Flink jobs and single page web applications with Vue.JS. I also have some experience with DevOps -- I've configured a microk8s Kubernetes cluster and deployed my services along with ElasticSearch, MongoDB, Apache Kafka, Apache Cassandra, Loki Stack and ClickHouse.

I like writing tests and docummentation for the stuff I'm building 😄. 

You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/denisnutiu/).

I also run a personal blog on [https://nuculabs.dev](https://nuculabs.dev) in which I write various technical posts.
