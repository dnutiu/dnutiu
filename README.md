# Hello 👋

I'm a professional software engineer with 10 years of experience and I work mainly as a full stack developer, developing APIs and front-end applications from scratch. I also do DevOps, working daily with Kubernetes, creating and configuring Helm charts and implementing observability solutions or testing pipelines.

You can read my personal software engineering blog at [https://nuculabs.dev](https://nuculabs.dev)💬.

You can also find most of my projects on my [Gitlab server](https://gitlab.nuculabs.dev/dnutiu) which I self-host.
