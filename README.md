### Hi there 👋

🧑‍💻

I’m Denis, a programmer living in 🇷🇴 Romania. I’m passionate about **cloud computing** and **software development** ✨.

During my day to day work I develop software in Python, Go, JavaScript and sometimes Java. 🪛

I have worked on CLIs, microservices, back-end web applications, Restful APIs, gRPC APIs, Apache Flink jobs and single page web applications with Vue.JS. 

Kubernetes is also a technology I enjoy working with.I’ve configured a microk8s Kubernetes cluster and deployed my applications along with their dependencies, which I manage using helm and Kubernetes operators. 🚀

At home I use Linux & Windows and at the job I currently use a MacOS system, previously I've used Linux. 👾

I like writing tests and documentation for the stuff I'm building 😄. 

I also run a personal blog on [https://nuculabs.dev](https://nuculabs.dev) in which I write various technical posts 💬.
